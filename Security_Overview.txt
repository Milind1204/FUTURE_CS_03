Security Overview - Secure File Sharing System
==============================================

1. Encryption Standard
----------------------
This application uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key length.
We utilize the EAX mode (Encrypt-then-Authenticate-then-Translate).
- Why EAX? It provides both confidentiality (secrecy) and authenticity (integrity).
- Unlike simpler modes like ECB, EAX prevents replay attacks and ensures the ciphertext has not been tampered with.

2. Key Management
-----------------
- Upon initialization, the system generates a random 32-byte (256-bit) key using `Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes`.
- This key is stored locally in `secret.key`.
- In a real-world production environment, this key would be managed via a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or secure environment variables to prevent unauthorized access.

3. File Handling
----------------
- Uploaded files are immediately read into memory and encrypted.
- The original unencrypted file is securely deleted from the disk (`os.remove`).
- Only the encrypted version (`.enc`) is stored in the `uploads/` directory.
- Decryption only occurs temporarily upon a user request with the correct key.
